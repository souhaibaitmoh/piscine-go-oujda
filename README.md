 📚 What I Learned

 🧩 Basics
- Go syntax and structure  
- Variables, constants, and types  
- Loops, conditionals, and functions  
- Working with slices, arrays, and maps  
- Understanding slice overflow and memory behavior  
- Handling errors and writing clean, readable code  

 ⚙️ Intermediate
- Structs and methods  
- Pointers and memory management  
- Interfaces and polymorphism  
- File I/O and package management  
- Recursion and backtracking  

 💡 Advanced Concepts
- Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, etc.)  
- Custom algorithm implementation  
- Problem-solving strategies  
- Code optimization techniques
